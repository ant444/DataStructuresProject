This project Implemented an inheritance hierarchy including a Circular Linked List, an Object Array, and a vector.

Users can insert a file to be read and choose to print the subclass iteratively or recursively.

TO RUN: ./app

Know a text file, you will be prompted for one. After that it will prompt a menu that will tell you your 8 options. 8 is to quit. 

Additionally, users can run via batch mode, where on command line, where you do ./app 'textfile.txt'

This was a project for my Data Structures class, and we had to use Doxygen & html to make a webpage for documentation. This was not included in this repository. 

If the documentation seems weird, if you see /param etc, that is for the site. Otherwise it is probably user error as there were many files to manage.
